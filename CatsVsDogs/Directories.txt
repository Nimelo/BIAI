For my first approach, I used the Mahotas library to get a 4*13 matrix of Haralick texture features for the entire image.  The texture features are described in a 1973 paper and the author describes building a decision tree.  Then I used sklearn library's logistic regression (which is implemented using liblinear) to classify.  I got a score of 0.64480 which is a lot better than random even though not so great overall.
